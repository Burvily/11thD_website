CREATE is an innovative self-service project management tool integrated into The Eleventhdimension platform, designed to revolutionize how construction and engineering projects are planned, executed, and monitored. CREATE empowers users to digitally manage their projects with AI-driven insights, structured workflows, and real-time monitoring.

Users can create projects, input relevant details, and let the AI generate an organized Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), breaking projects into milestones, tasks, resources, and cost estimations as it pertains to the userâ€™s project information. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), breaking projects into milestones, tasks, resources, timeline and cost estimations, is to be generated by AI. The only input required by the user is at the start (project creation form), where they describe their project in the details. From then on, the AI takes over breaking the projects into phases, WBS, generating associated tasks for each phase and resources, risk analysis, etc. Once the system creates the project and the AI generates the necessary details, a table-like dashboard is created that displays a high-level summary of the project status (RAG), timeline, tasks, resources, and costs. But a button should be available to see more comprehensive details about the progress of the project. Users only need to update task completion and expenses made as the project progresses, enabling the system to assess performance, generate reports, and provide actionable recommendations.
